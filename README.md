# Final Project

In this project, you will find the questions in [answers.ipynb](answers.ipynb).  This is convenient for displaying math equations. You can use [answers.ipynb](answers.ipynb) for written answers and running simulations/displaying plots.

You can run
```
conda install --file requirements.txt
```
to install the packages in [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt)

### Grading Rubric

The following rubric will be used for grading.

|   | Autograder | Correctness | Style | Total |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Problem 0 |  |   |  | /30 |
| Part A |    | /12 | /3 | /15 |
| Part B |    | /12 | /3 | /15 |
| Problem 1 |  |   |  | /20 |
| Part A |    | /8 | /2 | /10 |

| Part B |    | /4 |  | /4 |
| Part C |    | /13 | /2 | /15 |
| Problem 3 |  | /17 | /3 | /20 |


Correctness will be based on code (i.e. did you provide was was aksed for) and the content of [`answers.ipynb`](answers.ipynb).

To get full points on style you should use comments to explain what you are doing in your code and write docstrings for your functions.  In other words, make your code readable and understandable.
